Systemd Unitfile Linter

## Usage

```sh
usage: systemdlint [-h] [--nodropins] [--rootpath ROOTPATH] [--sversion SVERSION] [--output OUTPUT] [--norootfs] files [files ...]

Systemd Unitfile Linter

positional arguments:
  files                Files to parse

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --nodropins          Ignore Drop-Ins for parsing
  --rootpath ROOTPATH  Root path
  --sversion SVERSION  Version of Systemd to be used
  --output OUTPUT      Where to flush the findings (default: stderr)
  --norootfs           Run only unit file related tests
```

## Why should I use it?

Surely you can use `systemd-analyze verify [unitname]` to validate your units - no problem and it's
the recommended way if you writing units for the system you are currently running on.
Unfortunately systemd doesn't offer a validation which doesn't require an already running version of
systemd you want to validate against.

This tool was initially created to check units in cross-compiled embedded images at build time,
where you can't run a copy of systemd (as it's cross-compiled).
As a consequence it doesn't use any systemd code and might interpret some settings differently than
systemd itself - as with every linter take the outcomes as a basis for further analysis.
Also keep in mind, that systemd does create a larger stack of runtime files, which are not
taken into account by the tool - same for kernel related information like /dev, /sys or /proc
entries.

Furthermore the tool gives you advice how your unit files could be hardened.

## Installation

### PyPi

simply run

```sh
pip3 install systemdlint
```

### From source

* Install the needed requirements by running ```pip3 install systemdunitparser anytree```
* git clone this repository
* cd to \<clone folder\>/systemdlint
* run ```sudo ./build.sh```

## Output

The tool will return

```sh
{file}:{line}:{severity} [{id}] - {message}
```

example:

```sh
/lib/systemd/system/console-shell.service:18:info [NoFailureCheck] - Return-code check is disabled. Errors are not reported
/lib/systemd/system/plymouth-halt.service:11:info [NoFailureCheck] - Return-code check is disabled. Errors are not reported
/lib/systemd/system/systemd-ask-password-console.service:12:warning [ReferencedUnitNotFound] - The Unit 'systemd-vconsole-setup.service' referenced was not found in filesystem
/lib/systemd/system/basic.target:19:warning [ReferencedUnitNotFound] - The Unit 'tmp.mount' referenced was not found in filesystem
```

The output format is configurable with `--messageformat`, for example:

```sh
systemdlint --messageformat='{path}:{line}:{severity}:{msg}' ...
```

## Detectable Errors

* ConflictingOptions - The set option somehow is in conflict with another unit
* ErrorCyclicDependency - Unit creates a cyclic dependency
* ExecNotFound - The referenced executable was not found on system
* FullPrivileges - An executable is run with full privileges
* InvalidNumericBase - A numeric value doesn't match because it needs to be a multiple of X
* InvalidSetting - The option doesn't match the section
* InvalidValue - An invalid value is set
* MandatoryOptionMissing - A mandatory option was missing in the file
* Multiplicity - The option is not valid for the given amount of options in this context
* NoExecutable - The referenced executable is NOT executable
* NoFailureCheck - An executable is run without checking for failures
* OptionDeprecated - The used option is not available anymore in this version
* OptionTooNew - The used option will be available in a later version than used
